Do you want the viewpoint of the traveler or the spy? >S

Do you want the short variation or the long one? >L

Then let the story begin!
Why did you want to be a spy anyway? You could have had a nice restful job,
like an air-traffic controller. You could have tended flowers behind a white
picket fence around your country cottage. At least they could let you grab a
few winks between one job and the next. But no -- you finish debriefing in some
dirty little city in Frotzerland, and before you can even find a phone book,
let alone a hotel, they volunteer you for another assignment.

"You've got to intercept a document!" they told you. "Then deliver it to our
agent in Gola so the leak can be traced. We don't know where it is for sure,
but we think it's in a briefcase that's leaving town on the next train. You're
the only agent that's close enough and experienced enough to be sent after it.
And at the end of the trip, there will be a plane ticket to home waiting for
you."

So that's why you're climbing all over this stupid train. Finding the briefcase
was easy enough, but the dude carrying it was something else. Even a
well-placed bullet didn't make him drop. Now, if only he'll take the bait and
follow you up here, you can .... Wait! Here he comes from the forward end! But
he's not carrying the case!

Release 12 / Serial number 850403 / Spy's viewpoint, long variation

(roof)
You are on the roof of the train. The wind blows your hair, and the rocking,
lurching train threatens to buck you right off. It occurs to you that this
might not be the safest place to be right now.
The spy is here, preparing to knock you off.


Okay, what do you want to do now?
>KNOCK SPY OFF TRAIN

The train lurches a bit.
You go for him, but he dodges. The spy hesitates, then lunges at you!
He slips but then regains his footing.

What next?
>G

You lunge at him and almost miss, but he loses footing and falls off the edge
of the roof! The train quickly leaves his body behind.

What next?

(rear vestibule)
This is a small vestibule at the rear end of the car. There's a short flight of
metal steps on the left side of the train leading down off the train, and a
narrow metal ladder leading up to the roof. A small door leads to a restroom,
and a big window is open to the outside. A red handle is hanging by a short
length of cord from the ceiling, swinging in time to the train's rocking
motion. The train is racing along a barren stubble-plain.
The clatter of the wheels on the track is almost deafening.

What next?
>L AT FLOOR

The train lurches a bit.
You don't find anything new there.

What next?
>N

(You open the swinging door and close it again.)
The relative quiet here is welcome. 
(rear end)
This is the rear end of the corridor. The floor and walls are covered with
cream-colored linoleum, worn away in spots to reveal the original hardwood
finish. A long series of windows, still framed by wood, runs along the corridor
on the right-hand side of the train. On the left side of the train, behind a
windowed door, lies the fifth compartment.
A fat man is in the fifth compartment.
A thin woman is off to the front.
There's an attractive woman here, gazing out the window.

What next?

(first compartment)
[You're facing to the left side of the train.]
This is a once-luxurious first-class compartment on the Glrp-Wien Express. The
plush red upholstery on the two facing seats, shiny and worn in spots, and the
greasy lace on the headrests, give the car an air of faded elegance. A red
handle is hanging by a short length of cord from the ceiling, swinging in time
to the train's rocking motion. The corridor is outside, past a window with a
red curtain on it.
The train is rocketing past a dark, violent river.

[You're facing to the west.]
You are standing on the concrete platform of the Frbz railway station. A
cantilevered roof looms overhead, with occasional drops of rain water falling
from its edge. To the west is the entrance to the station house. To the east is

Do you want the viewpoint of the traveler or the spy? >S

Do you want the short variation or the long one? >L

Then let the story begin!
Why did you want to be a spy anyway? You could have had a nice restful job,
like an air-traffic controller. You could have tended flowers behind a white
picket fence around your country cottage. At least they could let you grab a
few winks between one job and the next. But no -- you finish debriefing in some
dirty little city in Frotzerland, and before you can even find a phone book,
let alone a hotel, they volunteer you for another assignment.

"You've got to intercept a document!" they told you. "Then deliver it to our
agent in Gola so the leak can be traced. We don't know where it is for sure,
but we think it's in a briefcase that's leaving town on the next train. You're
the only agent that's close enough and experienced enough to be sent after it.
And at the end of the trip, there will be a plane ticket to home waiting for
you."

So that's why you're climbing all over this stupid train. Finding the briefcase
was easy enough, but the dude carrying it was something else. Even a
well-placed bullet didn't make him drop. Now, if only he'll take the bait and
follow you up here, you can .... Wait! Here he comes from the forward end! But
he's not carrying the case!

You are on the roof of the train. The wind blows your hair, and the rocking,

from its edge. To the west is the women's restroom. To the east is a passenger
train, the Glrp-Wien Express, hissing and blowing off steam. The place is
crowded with people milling about, searching for a certain passenger or the
right car, or simply waiting.
One part of the crowd catches your eye: There's a young man here, checking a

Do you want the viewpoint of the traveler or the spy? >S

Do you want the short variation or the long one? >L

Then let the story begin!
Why did you want to be a spy anyway? You could have had a nice restful job,
like an air-traffic controller. You could have tended flowers behind a white
picket fence around your country cottage. At least they could let you grab a
few winks between one job and the next. But no -- you finish debriefing in some
dirty little city in Frotzerland, and before you can even find a phone book,
let alone a hotel, they volunteer you for another assignment.

"You've got to intercept a document!" they told you. "Then deliver it to our
agent in Gola so the leak can be traced. We don't know where it is for sure,
but we think it's in a briefcase that's leaving town on the next train. You're
the only agent that's close enough and experienced enough to be sent after it.
And at the end of the trip, there will be a plane ticket to home waiting for
you."

So that's why you're climbing all over this stupid train. Finding the briefcase
was easy enough, but the dude carrying it was something else. Even a
well-placed bullet didn't make him drop. Now, if only he'll take the bait and
follow you up here, you can .... Wait! Here he comes from the forward end! But
he's not carrying the case!

(roof)
You are on the roof of the train. The wind blows your hair, and the rocking,
lurching train threatens to buck you right off. It occurs to you that this
might not be the safest place to be right now.
The spy is here, preparing to knock you off.


Okay, what do you want to do now?

metal steps on the left side of the train leading down off the train, and a
narrow metal ladder leading up to the roof. A small door leads to a restroom,
and a big window is open to the outside. A red handle is hanging by a short
length of cord from the ceiling, swinging in time to the train's rocking
motion. The train is steaming along a barren stubble-plain.
The clatter of the wheels on the track is almost deafening.

(third booth)
[You're facing to the left side of the train.]

The attractive woman is here, smoking a cigarette.

[You're facing to the west.]
You are standing on the concrete platform of the Frbz railway station. A
cantilevered roof looms overhead, with occasional drops of rain water falling
from its edge. To the west is the women's restroom. To the east is a passenger
train, the Glrp-Wien Express, hissing and blowing off steam. The place is
crowded with people milling about, searching for a certain passenger or the
right car, or simply waiting.
One part of the crowd catches your eye: There's an old couple here, looking at
you with suspicion.

>L COUPLE

(I assume you mean: look at them, not look in them nor look for them nor any
other preposition.)
They are dressed for business, in shades of gray, with a strange odor. They
have a birthmark on one cheek like a wine stain.

It's not a very handsome document, scrawled in a hurry by a hand that wouldn't
win any prizes under the best of conditions. But it seems to contain crucial
information -- times, places, a crude map, even code words -- about a plan to
kidnap some high-ranking official tomorrow. Were the plan to succeed, several
governments would be embarrassed, if not in mortal danger, and the balance of
power would become precarious.

from its edge. To the west is the women's restroom. To the east is a passenger
train, the Glrp-Wien Express, hissing and blowing off steam. The place is

He has the uniform jacket of the Frotzian Railway, and a tie worn loosely with
an open collar, but blue jeans below. It seems a sensible outfit for both
selling tickets and hauling luggage.
He is holding a traveler's check.

win any prizes under the best of conditions. But it seems to contain crucial
information -- times, places, a crude map, even code words -- about a plan to
kidnap some high-ranking official tomorrow. Were the plan to succeed, several
governments would be embarrassed, if not in mortal danger, and the balance of
power would become precarious.

The train lurches a bit.
(I assume you mean: look at her, not look in her nor look for her nor any other

She was clearly beautiful as a young woman. Now her heavy make-up and cologne,
her fur piece and black net veil make her beauty a matter of personal
preference.
She is holding a yellow flower.

This is a diner booth on the Znuk-Potrzebie Express. In fact, it looks as if
the railway company just converted a first-class coach into a diner by removing
the door and adding a table to each compartment.
The train is hurtling along a barren stubble-plain.
The attractive woman is here, gazing out the window.
There seems to be something written on the window.

Do you want the viewpoint of the traveler or the spy? >S

Do you want the short variation or the long one? >L

Then let the story begin!
Why did you want to be a spy anyway? You could have had a nice restful job,
like an air-traffic controller. You could have tended flowers behind a white
picket fence around your country cottage. At least they could let you grab a
few winks between one job and the next. But no -- you finish debriefing in some
dirty little city in Frotzerland, and before you can even find a phone book,
let alone a hotel, they volunteer you for another assignment.

"You've got to intercept a document!" they told you. "Then deliver it to our
agent in Gola so the leak can be traced. We don't know where it is for sure,
but we think it's in a briefcase that's leaving town on the next train. You're
the only agent that's close enough and experienced enough to be sent after it.
And at the end of the trip, there will be a plane ticket to home waiting for
you."

So that's why you're climbing all over this stupid train. Finding the briefcase
was easy enough, but the dude carrying it was something else. Even a
well-placed bullet didn't make him drop. Now, if only he'll take the bait and
follow you up here, you can .... Wait! Here he comes from the forward end! But
he's not carrying the case!

(I assume you mean: look at her, not look in her nor look for her nor any other

her fur piece and black net veil make her beauty a matter of personal

from its edge. To the west is the women's restroom. To the east is a passenger

crowded with people milling about, searching for a certain passenger or the
