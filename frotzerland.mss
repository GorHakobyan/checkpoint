@center (FROTZENLAND - "SO GOOD YOU NEVER SAW")

Frotzenland is a country somewhere in Europe.
Its rugged terrain and mountainous borders help keep it safe from its
neighbours, yet easy to access with one airplane from Vienna.
Here you find something for every traveller: wild rivers, barren plains,
dark forests, clean cities, or friendly people.

@center (OUR BELOVED GOVERNMENT)

Every citizen in Frotzenland must vote in every election.
Our wise leaders find themselves elected again every time.
They conduct themselves as strictly neutral
government, with planning for every citizen's life and happiness.

@center (OUR BELOVED FOOD)

You will find something for every taste in Frotzenland.
Since the recent tractor reforms, all citizens do their parts
to grow abundantly for home use and visitors.
The good soil can produce fine meats and potatoes, wild games and cabbages.
And don't pass by local delicacies such as rumpled stilt's skin,
or fish heads and lice.

In a city you may find a good restaurant with Continental air
and attending services.  The finest food we can find for you.
And you may enjoy a good wine, with the taste of good soil from the
Thnbrd district.
