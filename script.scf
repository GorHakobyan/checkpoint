Do you want the viewpoint of the traveler or the spy? >s

Do you want the short variation or the long one? >l

Then let the story begin!
Why did you want to be a spy anyway? You could have had a nice restful job,
like an air-traffic controller. You could have tended flowers behind a white
picket fence around your country cottage. At least they could let you grab a
few winks between one job and the next. But no -- you finish debriefing in some
dirty little city in Frotzerland, and before you can even find a phone book,
let alone a hotel, they volunteer you for another assignment.

"You've got to intercept a document!" they told you. "Then deliver it to our
agent in Gola so the leak can be traced. We don't know where it is for sure,
but we think it's in a briefcase that's leaving town on the next train. You're
the only agent that's close enough and experienced enough to be sent after it.
And at the end of the trip, there will be a plane ticket to home waiting for
you."

So that's why you're climbing all over this stupid train. Finding the briefcase
was easy enough, but the dude carrying it was something else. Even a
well-placed bullet didn't make him drop. Now, if only he'll take the bait and
follow you up here, you can .... Wait! Here he comes from the forward end! But
he's not carrying the case!

(rear vestibule)
(You're facing to the rear, but you look in all directions for a moment.)
This is a small vestibule at the rear end of the car. It's just like the
forward vestibule, except for a short flight of metal steps on the left side of
the train leading down off the train, and a narrow metal ladder leading up to
the roof. A small door leads to a restroom, and a big window is open to the
outside. A red handle is hanging by a short length of cord from the ceiling,
swinging in time to the train's rocking motion. The train is hurtling past a
wild meadow.
The clatter of the wheels on the track is almost deafening.
The regal woman is here, still holding the briefcase and walking along. The
attractive man is here, still gazing out the window.

[You're facing to the west.]
You are standing on the concrete platform of the Frbz railway station. A
cantilevered roof looms overhead, with occasional drops of rain water falling
from its edge. To the west is the women's restroom. To the east is a passenger
train, the Glrp-Wien Express, hissing and blowing off steam. The place is
crowded with people milling about, searching for a certain passenger or the
right car, or simply waiting.
One part of the crowd catches your eye: There's an old man here, reading a
newspaper.

Then the young woman is gone.

kidnap some high-ranking official tomorrow. Were the plan to succeed, several
governments would be embarrassed, if not in mortal danger, and the balance of
power would become precarious.

[You're facing to the west.]
You are standing on the concrete platform of the Knut railway station. A
cantilevered roof looms overhead, with occasional drops of rain water falling
from its edge. To the west is the entrance to the station house. To the east is
a passenger train, the Glrp-Wien Express, hissing and blowing off steam. The
place is crowded with people milling about, searching for a certain passenger
or the right car, or simply waiting.
One part of the crowd catches your eye: There's a boy here, re-arranging
luggage.

Out of the corner of your eye, you see the regal woman leaving the train.
You watch as the conductor boards the train, and it slowly pulls out of Knut
station without you.
The regal woman stops here.
Do you want to keep waiting? >n

The time is now 13.02.

She was clearly beautiful as a young woman. Now her heavy make-up and cologne,
her fur piece and black net veil make her beauty a matter of personal

A guard, off to the north, stares at the regal woman for a moment, not
believing her eyes. Then she leaves in a hurry.
The regal woman blocks your thrust and delivers a chop to your nose.

A whistle sounds, and a passenger train comes screeching up to the platform. A
conductor leans out from one of the doors and shouts, "Potrzebie," then lowers
a short flight of metal steps and gets off.

The conductor approaches, accompanied by two grim-faced soldiers armed with
machine guns. They take things like battery very seriously here. He isn't
smiling as he says, "E fimstev lizjernetsnash jeffrpbobsnap."

After your arrest and a little gentle persuasion with beatings, cigarette burns
and starvation, you confess to the crime of espionage. Within days your
confession is front-page news around the world. And the Cold War gets a little
bit hotter...

This is a small vestibule at the rear end of the car. It's just like the
forward vestibule, except for a short flight of metal steps on the left side of
the train leading down off the train, and a narrow metal ladder leading up to
the roof. A small door leads to a restroom, and a big window is open to the
outside. A red handle is hanging by a short length of cord from the ceiling,
swinging in time to the train's rocking motion. The train is rocketing along a
barren stubble-plain.
The clatter of the wheels on the track is almost deafening.
A cigarette machine stands in one corner, waiting to be either used or
discarded -- it's hard to say which.
